## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This repository features a Gradio-based application built on the methods introduced in the MICCAI 2023 paper, "Adaptive Supervised PatchNCE Loss for Learning H&E-to-IHC Stain Translation with Inconsistent Groundtruth Image Pairs." The application facilitates automatic virtual staining, transforming H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) images into corresponding IHC (ImmunoHistoChemistry) images.

Users can generate virtual IHC stains for four key biomarkers critical to breast cancer diagnostics:
- HER2: Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2
- ER: Estrogen Receptor
- Ki67: Antigen KI-67 (cell proliferation marker)
- PR: Progesterone Receptor

This tool simplifies and accelerates the analysis of histopathological samples, making advanced diagnostic insights more accessible through virtual staining technology.
